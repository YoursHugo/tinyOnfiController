# tinyOnfiController
This is an intern project for the summer of 2024 at the Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

In this project, I am working on the design and implementation of a tiny ONFI controller for NAND flash memory. The controller is designed to be simple and efficient, and it is implemented in Verilog.
